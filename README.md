Mesh
----

A [Processing](http://processing.org/) library for computing convex hulls,
delaunay graphs and voronoi graphs from groups of points.

> The Mesh library was written for an older version of Processing in 2006, and
> isn't guaranteed to work anymore. Caveat lector.
>
> If you're interested in maintaining Mesh, bringing it up to support modern
> Processing - your help will be welcomed with open arms.
